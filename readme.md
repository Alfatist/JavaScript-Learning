How I learned JS // 02/22/2023 Course taken: https://youtu.be/BXqUH86F-kA (Curso em Video)

Every day, I studied the concepts and then practiced. 
As a result, now I can program a website, and it sure 
helps me programming anything. All projects are 
independents of each other.

There were classes purely theoretical, such as JS history. 
Here, however, I focused on practice.

There are the learn order:

1- First steps

very basic introduction to JavaScript.


2- First scripts

basic introduction to Javascript.


3- DOM

Introduction to DOM.

4- DOM events


Introduction to DOM events.

5- Conditions

Conditions concepts in computing.


6- Conditions 2

an in-depth look at conditions.


7- Project day's time (BETA)

Model to the project.


8- Project day's time

Depending on the time of day, the website shows a 
different image (in addition to changing the color).

this was the only project i didn't do alone, but 
with the teacher help.  

Well, I added a loading screen for myself. 
As I'm not a css expert, I searched how 
to make the loading circle.




9- Project age checker

An incomplete project; in theory, the user would type 
his birth's year and, according to his age, an image +
a text would appear. But I can't use photoshop or GIMP,
so I did other project: Guess the Colour Game! 

Notice: I only did Day's time because I could edit the
image in css, but for this project, would be very harder.


10- While statement

While statement in JavaScript.


11- For statement

For statement in JavaScript.


12- Project let's count

Practicing the For and While statements in JS. 
this was my worst project in the course, just bcz.


13- Project multiplication table

Practicing the For and While statements even more.


14- Arrays

Arrays in JS.


15- Functions

A bit of functions in JS. 


16- Project numbers analyzer

The coolest project, and the one I learned the most.
I did 70% of project for myself; like, 70%
I wanted to do, and 30% the teacher asked to do.
